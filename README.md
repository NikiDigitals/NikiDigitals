<h2>Welcome on the Github of Nikidigitals</h2>

My name is Nicolette. As a BSc (Hons) Computing and IT with Business student and ACCA candidate, I’m building expertise through academic and professional studies, certifications, and hands-on projects.
My passion lies in bridging finance and technology to transform the digital and financial landscape of global business and empowering organisations to lead with agility, insight, and future-focused performance.

My key focus:
•	Digital finance
•	ERP and enterprise systems integration
•  IT Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance
•	Secure information systems
•	Technology-driven innovation

This GitHub functions as my portfolio. It contains my notes, projects, and assignments from different subjects and courses. 
It’s a space where I document my learning journey, experiment with ideas, and develop my skill set.
